# Abstract
Pizza [@pizza2000identification] is an understudied yet widely utilized implement for delivering in-vivo *Solanum lycopersicum* based liquid mediums in a variety of next-generation mastications studies. Here\footnote{In-text foot note} we describe a de novo approach for large scale *T. aestivum* assemblies based on protein folding that drastically reduces the generation time of the mutation rate.

Sentence blah.\footnote{I'm a footnote: https://github.com/MrShoenel/md-2-pdf-pandoc-report-bib}
